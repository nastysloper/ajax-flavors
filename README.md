# AJAX Flavors

This repo demonstrates three approaches to AJAX comment submission in a simple Rails app. There are branches for each implementations:

* [No AJAX](https://github.com/ndelage/ajax-flavors)
* [Rails UJS with a JS Content-Type](https://github.com/ndelage/ajax-flavors/tree/rails-ujs-js)
* [Rails UJS with a JSON Content-Type](https://github.com/ndelage/ajax-flavors/tree/rails-ujs-json)
* [Jquery AJAX (JSON Content-Type) without any of the builtin Rails AJAX support](https://github.com/ndelage/ajax-flavors/tree/jquery-ajax-json)

Review the commits and compare the different implementations. Pull down the different branches and test each branch locally. Look at the server logs to compare the requests and use your browser's dev tools to review the responses.

I haven't looked at the code yet...
